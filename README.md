Lunar Lander

A game based on the original version by Atari from 1979.

Use the File tab, and then New Game to start the game.

Use the arrow keys to move the lander around, otherwise, it falls down on its own.

Minimize the game to pause it, and then click "OK" on the message to resume the game and restore the window.

Lead the lander so that it lands on a flat surface, otherwise, you will crash.

Exit the game as you normally would a window, or use File->Exit after the game is over.
